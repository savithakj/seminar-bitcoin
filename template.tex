%  Here enter the abstract of the paper.
Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized digital currency, allowing the easy 
storage and transfer of cryptographic tokens, using a peer-to-peer network to carry
information, hashing as a synchronization signal to prevent double-spending, 
and a powerful scripting system to determine ownership of the tokens. There is a 
growing technology and business infrastructure supporting it.


A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.

The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without 
redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the 
sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU 
power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not 
cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace 
attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on 
a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the 
longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

To send money, you broadcast to the network that the amount on your account 
should go down, and the amount on a receiver’s account up. Nodes, or computers,
in the Bitcoin network apply that transaction to their copy of the ledger, and then 
pass on the transaction to other nodes. This, with some math-based security, is 
really all there is--a system that lets a group of computers maintain a ledger.

Until Bitcoin’s invention in 2008 by the unidentified programmer known as Satoshi Nakamoto, online 
transactions always required a trusted third-party intermediary. For example, if Alice wanted to send \$100 
to Bob over the Internet, she would have had to rely on a third-party service like PayPal or MasterCard. 
Intermediaries like PayPal keep a ledger of account holders’ balances. When Alice sends Bob \$100, 
PayPal deducts the amount from her account and adds it to Bob’s account. Without such intermediaries, 
digital money could be spent twice. Imagine there are no intermediaries with ledgers, and digital cash 
is simply a computer file, just as digital documents are computer files. Alice could send \$100 to Bob 
by attaching a money file to a message. But just as with email, sending an attachment does not remove 
it from one’s computer. Alice would retain a copy of the money file after she had sent it. She could 
then easily send the same \$100 to Charlie. In computer science, this is known as the “double-spending” 
problem and until Bitcoin it could only be solved by employing a ledger-keeping trusted third party. Bit 
coin’s invention is revolutionary because for the first time the double-spending problem can be solved 
without the need for a third party. Bitcoin does this by distributing the necessary ledger among all the 
users of the system via a peer-to-peer network. Every transaction that occurs in the Bitcoin economy is 
registered in a public, distributed ledger, which is called the block chain. New transactions are checked 
against the block chain to ensure that the same bit coins haven’t been previously spent, thus eliminating 
the double-spending problem. The global peer-to-peer network, composed of thousands of users, takes the 
place of an intermediary; Alice and Bob can transact without PayPal. One thing to note right away is that 
transactions on the Bitcoin network are not denominated in dollars or Euros or yens they are on PayPal, 
but are instead denominated in Bitcoin. This makes it a virtual currency in addition to a decentralized 
payments network. The value of the currency is not derived from gold or government fiat, but from the 
value that people assign to it. The dollar value of a Bitcoin is determined on an open market, just as is the 
exchange rate between different world currencies.
